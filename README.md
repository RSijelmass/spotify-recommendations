# spotify-recommendations

This app uses the Spotify for Developers API set. If you want to play around
with this yourself, first log in at their [developer's home page](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and create a new app. Make note of your Client ID and Client Secret, as you will need them later.

## Setup
###Â Setting up the Repo
If you run this app with Python3, make sure to replace `pip` with `pip3`.

```
pip install numpy pandas spotipy matplotlib sklearn
```


### Scopes
Scopes are Spotify's way of ensuring third parties only get to see the
information you open up to them. If you want to alter any of them, a list can
be found
[here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/scopes/).

### Authentication
To be sure you are authenticated, you need to whitelist your callback URI into
the Spotify dashboard. You can do this by clicking `Edit Settings`.

## Training the Data
The first consideration I've made is using the [Decision Tree Classifier](https://medium.com/machine-learning-101/chapter-3-decision-trees-theory-e7398adac567) as
a classifier as it's the one that is easiest for me to visualise, and thus wrap
my head around.

## Things to Consider
It is important to think about how you would like to train your data. Do you train on the songs you like (giving them a positive score) and specify songs you dislike (giving them a negative scoring), or do you a assume all the songs you haven't trained on are defaulted at a negative score? The latter may be more interesting, but makes the training a little more complex. Therefore, on this first iteration, I have decided to specifically note what songs are classified as negative. Over time I would like to make this a little more sofisticated however.

A thing to keep in mind, when training on bad songs, is that the decision
making process for choosing "bad" songs is quite hard. One doesn't listen to
"bad" songs nearly as much as what they consider "good" songs, so you tend to go for
a stereotype of a bad song without managing to depict the nuances as much as
with the "good" songs.

I see this project becoming interesting when a user can give a specific dataset to train on (say, make "Recommended For You" playlists on specific moods they are in).
